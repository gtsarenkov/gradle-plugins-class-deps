/**
 * Determines whether a class is to be included in the jar.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Buildfile example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;classfilter&gt;
 *    &lt;include name=&quot;com.foo.&quot; &gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 *  &lt;exclude name=&quot;org&quot; &gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 *  &lt;/classfilter&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * As a class' dependancy lists are generated, each class is checked against a
 * ClassFilter by calling the <code>include</code> method. This method checks
 * the class name against its list of <i>includes</i> and <i>excludes</i> .
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * If the class name starts with any of the strings in the <i>includes</i> list,
 * the class is included in the jar and its dependancy lists are checked. If the
 * class name starts with any of the strings in the <i>excludes</i> list, the
 * class is <b>not</b> included in the jar and the dependancy analysis halts
 * (for that class).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Upon instantiation the class will look for a resource named <code>
 *   site-excludes</code> which is expected to contain a list of exclusion
 * patterns that are to be applied to all projects. This file contains one
 * pattern per line, with lines beginning with '#' being comments.<br/>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *      ##
 *      ## site wide exclusions
 *      ##
 *      # never include apache stuff in our jars
 *      org.apache.
 *      # never include IBM's stuff either
 *      com.ibm.
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <hr/>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that the following packages are excluded by default:
 * <code>java javax sun sunw com.sun org.omg</code>
 * </p>
